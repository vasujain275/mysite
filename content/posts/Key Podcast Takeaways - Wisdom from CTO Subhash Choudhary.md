Found this great podcast of Subhash Choudhary, CTO, Dukaan and his life journey. It was so entertaining that I watched the whole 3-hour podcast in one sitting. It was packed with knowledge, life experiences and insights. I thought of summarizing my leanings from this podcast into a small blog post. So, here are some of the key takeaways from this gem of a podcast -

## Be a Technologist first then a Businessman

We should never open a startup if we want to have a luxurious life or we want to get insanely rich, we will most likely lose motivation and fail. We should aspire to become *Good* *Technologists* who know their stuff and are excited about new tech coming out every day to make our lives better.

If you become a *Good* *Technologist,* you will eventually find ways to monetize your skills by building a product or service that will make people's lives easy.

## It's Okay to be employed

I had a feeling for the past few years that I didn't want a job, I wanted to start my own business. I think this is common for my age ambitious students because of social media. We think that we will be stuck in our jobs for our lives and will waste our lives working for others but from Subhash Choudhary's story I found out that industry experience is really valuable for our development.

## Monolithic vs Micro-Services Architecture

If you are building a product that may need to be expanded for different use cases in various countries in the future, avoid creating a monolithic software architecture. Instead, develop a core software that focuses solely on essential features vital to your product and add plugins or features as microservices on top of it.

## Cloud vs Bare Metal Servers

You can opt for bare-metal servers instead of cloud services like GCP or AWS, especially if you possess a strong knowledge of Kubernetes and Terraform. It's advisable to keep database backups in the cloud for added security since databases are the only components in our infrastructure that cannot be rapidly recreated. Infrastructure as code can be written once and requires only minor maintenance.

For early-stage startups, going with the cloud is a safer choice, as you may not have a clear idea about your growth and user base. However, once your startup matures and you have gathered data about your growth and users, transitioning to bare metal can result in significant cost savings.

These were some key points that I learned from this podcast, do check out the full podcast linked below to learn about this guy's inspiring and amazing experiences.
